# UWM-Security-Utilities
Development for a client

This utility application is used to retrieve Epic(tm) security build information for SharePoint365.  The components are built with React, so they are portable and can be leveraged in any web applcation, not just SharePoint.

Some of the functions of the API are:
- Show if a user has a currently active account
- Show demographics such as name, email, phone
- Show what Linkable Security Template and Subtemplates are assigned
- Show what provider record is assigned

Other uses will be updated here as design continues along with development during rapid prototyping.
